# movieTheaterBackEnd

**_MongoDB, Express, Node.js_**

- Developed as an example of what a movie theater might use to update the movies that they are showing and when they are playing with CRUD functionality.
- The Back-end utilizes Node.js for API endpoints within an Express app and MongoDB for data modeling. The server has RESTful API endpoints and API calls always return expected results.
- The server is hosted on a shared server so the intial load time is slower but once the app is running the the performance is quicker.
